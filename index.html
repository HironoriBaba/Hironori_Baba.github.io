			<p>Hi there!</p>
			<br/>
			<p>My name is Hiro, and I am a fourth year mechanical engineering student at UC Davis. I am interested in mechanical design, as well as the analysis and testing that goes behind it to ensure its reliability. Outside of engineering, I enjoy playing baseball and piano, as well as going out to get great food. Please feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or have any questions!</p>

				<p>I worked on Yamaha's next generation electric keyboard!</p>
				<p>Specifically, I invented a keyboard that is shorter than 30% compared to previous models using a linkage mechanism. This size reduction methodology is special, because I also improved how the keyboard feels to a performer (usually size and feel is a tradeoff). To verify my design, I developed a semantic differential survey to gather feedbacks from other mechanical engineers at Yamaha, and assessed the results. The design is now being considered for a patent by Yamaha, and I helped brainstorm for the company's internal patent application. In the meantime, I also learned about how to design for injection molding, felt a lot of keyboards, and played baseball with my coworkers!</p>

				<p>I developed a document platform migration project at Genentech's Vacaville site. This included formulating a strategy document, communicating with different teams, and actually executing the migration. By the time I left, I executed more migrations than what was done at HQ!</p>
