				<p>I worked on Yamaha's next generation electric keyboard!</p>
				<p>Specifically, I invented a keyboard that is shorter than 30% compared to previous models using a linkage mechanism. This size reduction methodology is special, because I also improved how the keyboard feels to a performer (usually size and feel is a tradeoff). To verify my design, I developed a semantic differential survey to gather feedbacks from other mechanical engineers at Yamaha, and assessed the results. The design is now being considered for a patent by Yamaha, and I helped brainstorm for the company's internal patent application. In the meantime, I also learned about how to design for injection molding, felt a lot of keyboards, and played baseball with my coworkers!</p>

				<p>I developed a document platform migration project at Genentech's Vacaville site. This included formulating a strategy document, communicating with different teams, and actually executing the migration. By the time I left, I executed more migrations than what was done at HQ!</p>

			<h1>CUSTOM QUADCOPTER</h1>
			<h2>Fall 2017 - Spring 2018</h2>
			<p>Mechanical Team Lead</p>
			<p>I lead the design and manufacture of custom quadcopter. This was the team's very first build project, so the goal was to create a simple, but modifiable quadcopter. The mechanical team had a $100 budget, but I spent less than $50 for the physical parts of the drone!</p>

			<h1>3D PRINTED MULTI-TOOL</h1>
			<h2>Winter 2017 - Spring 2017</h2>
			<p>1st place recipient</p>
			<p>I was part of a team of 5 in a competition where we were tasked with designing and prototyping a multi-tool. The competition emphasized safety and usability, as well as the number of tools. I modeled parts of the multi-tool, ran FEA for our documentation, and 3D printed prototypes.</p>
